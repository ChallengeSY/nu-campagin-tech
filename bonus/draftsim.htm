<h2>Draft Simulator Instructions</h2>
<p>You and many simulated computer opponents will be given packs of cards. Your job is to create a composition that will suit you well throughout a specialist 16-player blitz tournament, without knowing what your opponents will pick.</p>

<p>Your job is somewhat simple. The draft phase begins when you receive a pack of <em>seven</em> random cards (imagine opening a booster pack). These cards become part of the draft system (thus, remaining in the <strong>New cards</strong> section).</p>

<p>During the draft phase, you will pick <em>one</em> card from the rotation, and it will be added to your collection. You pass the other cards to your next opponent, while receiving unpicked cards from your previous opponent. Repeat the drafting process until you have no more cards to add for the round. The draft phase is skipped in the final round of the tournament.</p>

<p>After drafting, you will advance to the play phase. You will <em>slowly</em> play out your hand, in a simulated best of three setting (until round 4, where it increases to a best of five). Cards that you play are usually <em>consumed</em>, so use them wisely. In the live setting, you will play <em>one</em> race card, plus optionally any add-on cards, and play a blitz game with that card against your paired opponent who will have also selected card(s). If you really do not like your options, you can click on <strong>Random race</strong>, which is a key item. Key items are valuable in that their abilities are re-usable</p>

<p>After resolution (assuming you survive, and that there are still opponents left), it switches to the next draft phase. Since the card system is exclusive to this environment, you will not keep the cards after the tournament is over</p>
